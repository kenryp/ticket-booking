# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ticket-booking

<!-- Creating a train ticket booking app like Trainline with React involves several steps. Below, I’ll outline a high-level roadmap for you:

Set up your development environment:

Install Node.jsand npm.

Create a new React project using Create React App: npx create-react-app train-ticket-booking-app.

Install necessary packages: react-router-dom for routing, axios for API requests, and material-ui for UI components.

Design the app’s structure:

Plan the layout and user flow.

Define the main components such as HomePage, SearchPage, ResultsPage, BookingPage, and ConfirmationPage.

Set up the basic routes using react-router-dom.

Build the HomePage component:

Create a form for users to input travel details like departure and destination cities, travel dates, and passenger details.

Add a search button that redirects users to the SearchPage with their input data.

Create the SearchPage component:

Fetch train data from an API using axios (you can use mock data for development).

Display available trains in a list with their details such as departure time, arrival time, duration, and price.

Add a button for each train option to proceed to the BookingPage.

Develop the BookingPage component:

Allow users to select seats and provide passenger information.

Display the booking summary and a button to confirm the booking.

Set up the ConfirmationPage component:

Show the booking confirmation details and a unique booking reference.

Provide options to view booking history or make a new booking.

Handle state management:

Use React’s state management (useState and useContext) to manage the app’s data flow.

Store user input and booking information.

Add authentication (optional):

Implement user authentication using libraries like Firebase or Auth0 if you want users to create accounts and log in.

Style the app:

Use Material-UI components for a modern look.

Create a consistent design and user experience.

Test and deploy the app:

Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly.

Deploy the app using services like Vercel or Netlify. -->
